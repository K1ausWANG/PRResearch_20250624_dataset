# First Results of Quasiparticle Interference Visualized by High-Spatial-Resolution Photoemission Electron Microscopy  

This repository contains the dataset and analysis code for the manuscript titled "First Results of Quasiparticle Interference Visualized by High-Spatial-Resolution Photoemission Electron Microscopy". The data includes raw photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) images, simulated quasiparticle interference (QPI) feature (including electronic density oscillation and blurred image with contrast transfer function method),and the processed data used to generate the figures in the publication.

This dataset enables the full reproduction of the main results and figures presented in the manuscript.
